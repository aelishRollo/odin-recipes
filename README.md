A sample project to flex my HTML muscles

The purpose is not only to make use of what I've learned about the fundamental file structure and contents of 
websites and webpages (which includes using things like paragraphs, divs, lists, etc), but also to become
proficient in using github in the context of working on a project. This includes things like writing good commit messages, committing frequently, and pushing at the appropriate times. My final aim is to have fun doing this.
