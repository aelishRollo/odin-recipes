	  <h3>  Description </h3>
	  <p>
		Not only are these wings acceptable to eat while following a ketogenic diet, they're so tasty that
		we must warn you that there's a high risk of weeping sweet sweet tears of joy. So buckle up.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		One of the things that makes these wings so great is that they're simple to make, but they're also
		so versatile. This is due to the recipe's inherent modularity. In this recipe, we'll combine our
		wings with any vegetable that one desires. We'll do the same with seasonings and sauces. In terms
		of veggies, I'm partial to brussels sprouts or broccoli, but you could add just about anything,
		other than the tears of your enemies (because that's not a vegetable).
