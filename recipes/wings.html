	  <h3>  Description </h3>
	  <p>
		Not only are these wings acceptable to eat while following a ketogenic diet, they're so tasty that
		we must warn you that there's a high risk of weeping sweet sweet tears of joy. So buckle up.

	  <p>
		One of the things that makes these wings so great is that they're simple to make, but they're also
		so versitile. This is due to their inherent modularity. In this recipe, we'll combine our wings with		    any vegetable that one desires. I'm partial to brussels sprouts or broccoli, but you could add just
		about anything.
