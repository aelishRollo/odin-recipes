	  <h3>  Description </h3>
	  <p>
		Not only are these wings acceptable to eat while following a ketogenic diet, they're so tasty that
		we must warn you that there's a high risk of weeping sweet sweet tears of joy. So buckle up.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
		One of the things that makes these wings so great is that they're simple to make, but they're also
		so versatile. This is due to the recipe's inherent modularity. In this recipe, we'll combine our
		wings with any vegetable that one desires. We'll do the same with seasonings and sauces. In terms
		of veggies, I'm partial to brussels sprouts or broccoli, but you could add just about anything,
		other than the tears of your enemies (because that's not a vegetable).

	  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
	  <ul>
		<li> Raw Chicken Wings (or drumsticks) </li>
		<li> Your Vegetable of Choice </li>
		<li> Your Seasoning of Choice </li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3>Steps</h3>
	  <ol>
		  <li>Preheat your oven to 400F</li>
		  <li>Add your chicken wings to the pan, coated in butter/olive oil/avacado oil, mixed with spices of your choosing. I like salt and pepper, garlic, onion, lemon, basil. These are tasty in any combination.</li>
		  <li>Add your veggies to the oven in their own pan, with their own seasonings. </li>
		  <li>After 20 to 25 minutes, remove your veggie pan from the oven. This timing works well for broccoli and brussels sprouts. </li>
		  <li>After 40 minutes, remove your pan from the oven, allow it to cool off, and feast like the raiders of yore. You can also leave the wings in for another 15 minutes if you like them extra crispy. </li>
	  </ol>
