          <h3>  Description </h3>
          <p>
	  Possibly the most versatile of all potential recipes in the multiverse, the one, the only, <strong> SALAD</strong>. Salad consistents of e elements:
	  	<ul>
			<li>greens</li>
			<li>protien</li>

          </p>
          <p>
                One of the things that makes these wings so great is that they're simple to make, but they're also
                so versatile. This is due to the recipe's inherent modularity. In this recipe, we'll combine our
                wings with any vegetable that one desires. We'll do the same with seasonings and sauces. In terms
                of veggies, I'm partial to brussels sprouts or broccoli, but you could add just about anything,
                other than the tears of your enemies (because that's not a vegetable).
          </p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
                <li> Raw Chicken Wings (or drumsticks) </li>
                <li> Your Vegetable of Choice </li>
                <li> Your Seasoning of Choice </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
                  <li>Preheat your oven to 400F</li>
                  <li>Add your chicken wings to the pan, coated in butter/olive oil/avacado oil, mixed with spices of your choosing. I like salt and pepper, garlic, onion, lemon, basil. These are tasty in any combination.</li>
                  <li>Add your veggies to the oven in their own pan, with their own seasonings. </li>
                  <li>After 20 to 25 minutes, remove your veggie pan from the oven. This timing works well for broccoli and brussels sprouts. </li>
                  <li>After 40 minutes, remove your pan from the oven, allow it to cool off, and feast like the raiders of yore. You can also leave the wings in for another 15 minutes if you like them extra crispy. </li>
          </ol>
